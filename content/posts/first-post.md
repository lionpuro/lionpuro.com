# First post

Hello and welcome!

My plan for this site is for it to be a place where I can track my progress
and document interesting things I learn.
I'm looking forward to writing about my experiments and hopefully gaining
a deeper understanding while improving my writing skills in the process.
TypeScript is great, but it's not quite there yet when it comes to
expressing ourselves in everyday conversations and literature.

I think that's it for the mandatory first post.
I'll post when I have something to talk about,
whether it's a solution to an interesting problem,
something I've learned, or a small note I want to save here.
